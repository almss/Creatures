# Creatures

instructions: Move the cursor around the screen to attract the creatures and to change the state press the mouse button. 

My biggest challenge with this was changing the state of the 'creatures'. I managed to change the colour of them when the mouse is pressed but the intention wasn't to change them all. Just the ones that are moving towards the cursor as well, the ones that are closest to the cursor when moving away from it.
